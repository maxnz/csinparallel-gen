# Runs a series of tests that can fairly easily be copied into the spreadsheet.

# Author: Libby Shoop

# Usage:
#          bash ./run_strong_tests.sh 4
#    will run each problem size set below 4 times using a variety of thread counts

# Notes: 1. you must set the number of times you want to run each test
#           by including it on the command line.
#       2. both trap-seq.c and trap-omp.c need to be updated to print out only
#          this line and ALL OTHER printf lines should be commented:
#         printf("%lf\t",elapsed_time);
num_times=$1

# print a header for the trial, #threads, and set of probelm sizes
# Note: you should set the problem sizes that you want to run for a problem.
#       The following are fairly good for the trapezoidal rule problem
#       and for the strong scalability problem sizes and number of threads.
